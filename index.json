Above this limit, it is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the time-steady Euler equation and the strong shock jump conditions, and the system undergoes a time-dependent transition to a thermal wind. This physics has been shown to explain the existence of a critical neutrino luminosity in steady-state models of proto-neutron star accretion in the context of core-collapse supernovae. Here, we extend the antesonic condition to flows with rotation and turbulence using a simple one-dimensional formalism. We show that both effects decrease the critical post-shock sound speed required for explosion. While quite rapid rotation is required for a significant change to the critical condition, we show that the level of  turbulence typically achieved in multi-dimensional supernova simulations can greatly impact the critical antesonic ratio. Specifically, a core angular velocity corresponding to a millisecond rotation period after contraction of the proto-neutron star results in only a $\\sim5$ per-cent reduction of the critical curve. In contrast, near-sonic isotropic or anisotropic turbulence described by specific turbulent kinetic energy $K/c\\_T^2=0.5-1$, leads to a decrease in the critical value of $c\\_T^2/v\\_{\\rm esc}^2$ by $\\sim20-40$ per-cent. We further show that there is a maximum on the specific turbulent kinetic energy of $\\simeq v\\_{\\rm esc}^2/4$ above which accretion with any finite value of $c\\_T$ is impossible.  This analysis provides a framework for understanding the role of post-shock turbulence in instigating explosions in models that would otherwise fail and helps explain why multi-dimensional simulations explode more easily than their one-dimensional counterparts.","tags":["antesonic","supernovae","explosion mechanism"],"title":"The Antesonic Condition for the Explosion of Core-Collapse Supernovae II: Rotation and Turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The Antesonic Condition and Magnetocentrifugal Winds Matthias J Raives | 21 Oct 2020\n The Antesonic Condition  Pejcha \u0026amp; Thompson (2012) found that, for an isothermal equation of state, the Euler equations and the shock-jump conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied when\n$\\frac{c_T^2}{v_{\\rm esc}^2} \\geq \\frac{3}{16}$\nat the shock.\n The Antesonic Condition As $c_T$ increases, the shock moves out to larger radii, until no shocked solution can be found\n (image1)   (image2)   (image3)   (image4)   (image5)   Time-Dependent Simulations In time-dependent simulations, when the antesonic condition is exceeded, the accretion flow undergoes a time-dependent transition into a wind solution.

But at the end of the day, you spend months running these simulations and end up with one, or a handful of models. These individual examples of success or failure do not illuminate the fundamental physics of explosion — we know that there is a \u0026ldquo;landscape\u0026rdquo; of explosion, where similar progenitors may have very different explosion properties. So individual successful and failed explosions cannot easily distinguish between \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; failed explosions (i.e., models that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t explode, vs those that should). So we need another approach  If this steady state continues indefinitely, the PNS will collapse into a black hole.
