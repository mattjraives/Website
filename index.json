Using the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code Athena++ we calculate the mass loss rate and angular momentum loss rate as a function of the stellar rotation rate, the magnetic dipole moment, the ratio of the isothermal sound speed to the escape velocity, and the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes. We discuss applications of our results to the spindown of normal stars, and to nascent highly-magnetic and rapidly-rotating neutron stars born in massive star core collapse.","tags":null,"title":"Magnetized Rotating Isothermal Winds of Proto-Neutron Stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Here, we extend the antesonic condition to flows with rotation and turbulence using a simple one-dimensional formalism that highlights the basic physics of the antesonic condition. We show that both effects decrease the critical post-shock sound speed required for explosion. While quite rapid rotation is required for a significant change to the critical condition, we show that the level of  turbulence typically achieved in multi-dimensional supernova simulations can greatly impact the critical antesonic ratio. Specifically, a core angular velocity corresponding to a millisecond rotation period after contraction of the proto-neutron star results in only a $\\sim5$ per-cent reduction of the critical curve. In contrast, near-sonic isotropic turbulence described by specific turbulent kinetic energy $K/c_T^2=0.5-1$, leads to a decrease in the critical sound speed by $\\sim20-30$ per-cent. This analysis provides a framework for understanding the role of post-shock turbulence in instigating explosions in models that would otherwise fail, and thus allows us to more fully connect the antesonic condition to multi-dimensional full-physics simulations.","tags":["antesonic","supernovae","explosion mechanism"],"title":"The Antesonic Condition for the Explosion of Core-Collapse Supernovae II: Rotation and Turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569498300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597254128,"objectID":"7742deb33509d02b185fe21308565e3d","permalink":"https://mattjraives.github.io/talk/mwst19b/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T11:45:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mwst19b/","section":"talk","summary":"In the model problem of steady spherically-symmetric pressure-less free-fall onto a standing shockwave around an accreting central mass, the “antesonic” condition limits the regime of stable accretion to $c^2\\_T/v^2\\_{\\rm esc}\\leq 3/16$,  where $c\\_T$ is the isothermal sound speed in the subsonic post-shock flow, and $v\\_{\\rm esc}$ is the escape velocity at the shock radius.

While it is known that in a neutrino-powered CCSN, explosion begins when the neutrino luminosity of the protoneutron star exceeds a critical value, the physics of this condition in time-dependent, multidimensional simulations is not fully understood. Pejcha \u0026 Thompson found that an \"antesonic condition\" exists for time-steady spherically symmetric models, potentially giving a physical explanation for the critical curve observed in simulations. In this paper, we extend that analysis to time-dependent, spherically symmetric polytropic models. We verify the critical antesonic condition in our simulations, showing that models exceeding it drive transonic winds whereas models below it exhibit steady accretion. In addition, we find that (1) high spatial resolution is needed for accurate determination of the antesonic ratio and shock radius at the critical curve, and that low-resolution simulations systematically underpredict these quantities, making explosion more difficult at lower resolution; (2) there is an important physical connection between the critical mass accretion rate at explosion and the mass-loss rate of the post-explosion wind: the two are directly proportional at criticality, implying that, at criticality, the wind kinetic power is tied directly to the accretion power; (3) the value of the post-shock adiabatic index $\\Gamma$ has a large effect on the length and time-scales of the post-bounce evolution of the explosion, larger values of $\\Gamma$ result in a longer transition from the accretion to wind phases.","tags":null,"title":"The antesonic condition for the explosion of core-collapse supernovae - I.

We extend these to include ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are second-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a divergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains $\\nabla\\cdot B\\approx 0$. We implement these in the code GIZMO, together with state-of-the-art SPH MHD. We consider a large test         suite, and show that on all problems the new methods are competitive with AMR using constrained transport (CT) to ensure $\\nabla\\cdot B = 0$. They correctly capture the growth/structure of the magnetorotational instability, MHD turbulence, and launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than state-of-the-art AMR. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit convergence at fixed neighbour number, sharp shock-capturing, and dramatically reduced noise divergence errors, and diffusion. Still, \"modern\" SPH can handle most test problems, at the cost of larger kernels and \"by hand\"         adjustment of artificial diffusion. Compared to non-moving meshes, the new methods exhibit enhanced \"grid noise\" but reduced advection errors and diffusion, easily include self-gravity, and feature velocity-independent errors and superior angular momentum conservation. They converge more slowly on some problems (smooth, slow-moving flows), but more rapidly on others involving advection/rotation). In all cases, we show divergence control beyond the Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or all methods can converge to unphysical answers even at high resolution.","tags":null,"title":"Accurate, meshless methods for magnetohydrodynamics","type":"publication"}]
